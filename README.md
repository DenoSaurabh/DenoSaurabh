## Hi there 👋

Hello, I am **Saurabh, Full Stack Developer & Designer**, you can also call me as **deno** :D. I am quite a confident person, always curious about learning new technologies and tools in the market. Understanding things in deep is always my main goal. How we can better architect our app? what tech. to use? and with great planning is always the main step for me, very important while building big scale apps. Although, I don't make particularly strong opinions rather I always take a step forward to use modern tools in apps. I have a great sense of web design. I always love those web apps having great animations and UI. I think they are very important for a successful app. I always deliberate myself to make apps better and better. 🙂
