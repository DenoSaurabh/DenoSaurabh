### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am quite confident person, always curious in learning new technologies and tools in the market, adapting things in very deep is always my main goal. How we can better architect our app, what tech. to use and with a straight great planning is always a main step for me, very important while building big scale apps. Although, I don't make very strong opinions but always make a step forward to use modern tools in apps. I have a great sense of web design. I always love those webapps having great animations and UI. I think they are very important for a successful app. I always deliberate myself to make apps better and better. ðŸ™‚
